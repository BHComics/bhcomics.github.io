**Exploring black holes through art and science**

Welcome to the **Black Holes Comics** initiative â€” a collaboration between scientists and artists to communicate the fascinating world of black hole physics through visual storytelling.

We will make the fascinating ideas from **general relativity, black holes and gravitational waves** accessible to everyone through engaging comics and illustrations. Here you will find suggestions of external material for the project.
